# Future official Dev branch
In the process of extracting code of the business case from the web application layer. The web application will then be importing "adaptive_learning" as a library.

To make it possible, "adaptive_learning" should be a package. Run the following instructinos in a terminal, where the file setup.py is located:
```
python sdist bdist_wheel build
python setup.py develop
```

To understand where these come from see [a very quick note](https://github.com/AlexisBogroff/CheatSheets/blob/master/PythonPackaging.md#install-the-package)
or its [source article](https://python-packaging-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_py.html)
