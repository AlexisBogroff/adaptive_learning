# How to run the virtual website

- Open a terminal
- Go to a location where you want to place a new virtual environment (using the command "cd" to move along the directories, and "ls" to display what is contained in the folder)
- Create a virtualenv (using Python3): "virtualenv [envName] -p python3.6"
- Go inside this new folder: "cd [envName]"
- Activate this new environment: "source bin/activate" (on Mac)
- Install Django using pip: "pip install django"
- Go to the folder containing the code that I provided (you should be able to see a file named manage.py in your folder)
- Write the command: "python3 manage.py runserver"
- "Ctrl + click" the link (or copy http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser)


## The terminal should display something like:

```
